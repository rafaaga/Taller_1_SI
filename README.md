# Taller_1_SI

This project is a short, original musical piece created using sampling techniques in Audacity. The composition is at least 30 seconds long and was produced by creatively combining and editing samples from three different audio sources. The goal was to explore how digital tools like Audacity can be used to repurpose existing sounds into a new artistic creation.
Process and Justification
I selected samples from three distinct sources. Using Audacity, I edited, trimmed and layered the samples to build a cohesive structure. I focused on maintaining a balance between familiarity and originality, giving new meaning to each sound through context and transformation. This method allowed me to develop creative and technical skills in audio editing, while also emphasizing the artistic potential of remixing.
